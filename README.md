# rsc3 for Racket


This is a port of the [rsc3](http://rd.slavepianos.org/?t=rsc3) super collider client to Racket, organized as a Racket package. Used the Thu Jun 27 2013 version.

## Install

Install with `raco pkg install rsc3`, assuming racket/bin is in PATH.

## Using

`(require rsc3)`

This also exports `send`, which is from the sosc collection. (TODO - need to fix sosc exports)
