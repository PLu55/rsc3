This can be installed in two different ways:

## Concepts

You can play notes from instruments on specific tracks.

The purpose of playing notes on different tracks is we can have different filters on different tracks. For example, the melody track can have a low pass filter, and and the drums track could have a delay filter.


- Instrument: This is equivalent to choosing what the note sounds like. There are default instruments (saw wave, piano, etc.) and you can also define your own using samples.
