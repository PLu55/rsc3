## Interface



### DAW-like model

Oregano will have these concepts/objects:


- track: like a "track" in renoise. can have notes, and a list of effects.


- instrument: instrument defenitions or presets, and actual instantiated instruments.
  - I should make some instrument presets, like sine, saw, square, triangle waves.

- filters: can be added to tracks. e.g. reverb, low pass filter.


## Functionality

- adding filters
